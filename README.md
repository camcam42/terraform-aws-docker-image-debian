# Terraform-aws-docker-image  

Just a Debian slim image that contains the Terraform and AWS cli with Jq (to hable JSON responses from AWS). 

I shamelessly took the [Dockerfile from a Zenika image](https://github.com/zenika-open-source/terraform-aws-cli/blob/master/Dockerfile).  
All credits to Zenika's people for this work. To learn more, please visit the [Github repo of their project](https://github.com/zenika-open-source/terraform-aws-cli).  
But the last update from Zenika was more than 5 months ago (at the time of the beginning of this project) but really well made, the goal of the current image I'm building is purely to have the updated versions of the different tools and nothing more.  

This is a personal project, don't except too frequent updates.
